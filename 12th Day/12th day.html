        <h2>Git And Github</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git:</li>
          <p>
            Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
            designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
            speed and efficiency. It is a local system.
          </p>
          <li>Github:</li>
          <p>
            GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and
            collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from
            anywhere. It is a cloud based system.
          </p>

        <h2>Graphical User Interface vs. Command Line Interface</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</li>
          <p>
            GUI is an interface that allows user to perform action by using
            different graphical representation like by clicking icon, dragging
            files/folders etc. It is very easy to use.
          </p>
          <li>Command Line Interface (CUI):</li>
          <p>
            CUI is an interface that allows user to perform action by typing
            commands. It is a bit difficult to use than GUI but is faster.
          </p>

            want to create.<br />

          </p>
          <li>Delete Folder:</li>
          <p>
            To remove folder, we use "rmdir" command which stands for Remove

            to delete.<br />
            <span id="note"><i>Eg: </i>rmdir folder1</span>
          </p>
          <li>Create file:</li>
