    <h1>This is a Heading.</h1>
    <p>Today we have learnt about heading tags in this course. We learnt about the different heading tags in todays course.<br>
    Heading can be from h1 to h6. h1 heading is the biggest one while h6 heading is the smallest one.<br>
    We use heading to give title to a topic as well as to seperate different section in the web page.<br>
    Seperating different sections and making it clear also helps to rank our website in the World Wide Web.
