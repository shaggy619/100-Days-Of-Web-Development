        <h2>Web Hosting and Deployment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Web Hosting:</li>
          <p>
            Web hosting is simply a remote machine (server) that hosts (stores)
            the website code and serves it to visitors.
          </p>
          <li>Deployment:</li>
          <p>
            Deployment means moving the website code to a remote machine is

        <h2>Hosting our First Website</h2>
        <p>
          Today we published our first website and it was live with
          <a href="https://app.netlify.com/drop">Netlify Drop</a>. We simply drag
          and drop our main folder where our HTML and CSS files were located and
          then our website was live <a href="https://hopeful-cray-d18e26.netlify.app">
          Here</a>.
        </p>
        <p id="note">
          <i>Note: </i>This is only for testing purposes,we have to buy custom
          domain name and hosting plan if we really wish to publish our website.

        <h2>Favicon</h2>
        <p>
          A favicon is simply a little icon or logo that is shown next to the
          title of the website in top address bar of the browser. By default
          there is a logo for every website. We can also add our customized
          favicon. We can find many sites that create the favicon for free. Just
          search favicon generator and upload picture/logo that you want to use
          as favicon, then download the zip file and unzip it and find .ico file
          and link it to the head section of HTML code using link;
          <pre>
            <code>
              &lt;link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="image.ico"&gt;
            </code>
