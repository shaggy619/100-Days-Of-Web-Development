      <h2>Introduction to Box Model</h2>
      <p>
        The box model is used while designing the HTML page. It is basically a
        box that wraps all the contents around it. It consists of margins,
        padding, border and the content.

      <h2>Using Box Model</h2>
      <p>
        We can use Box Model to set different margins, paddings and border to
        the page. We have previously used margin in our previous course so today
        we are going to work with padding and border. Adding padding is similar 
        to that of margin and to add border we have to give first value as its 
        width, second value of its type and third value of its color.
        <pre><code>
            a {
                border: 1px solid #ffffff;
            }
        </code></pre>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="style1"><a href="#">No padding</a></li>
        <li class="style1"><a href="#" id="padding1">Padding</a></li>
        <li class="style1"><a href="#" id="paddingborder">Border</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Creating HTML Layouts</h2>
      <p>It is not a must need but a better practice to add different section in HTML page.
          It makes easier to differentiate between the contents for ourselves as the code gets
          long and for other developers who will see our code too. Basically we use <i>header,
          main </i>and <i>footer</i> in todays course.
      </p>
      <h2>Core Selector</h2>
      <p>We have previously discuss about some of the basic selectore like element selector
         and id selector. Today we are going to learn about few more selectors which are <i>
         Group selector </i> and <i>Class selector</i>. To use group selector can select two or more elements 
         and set same style to both of the elements by simply using commas between them.
         <pre><code>
             h3, p {
                 color: #ffffff;
             }
         </code></pre>
         This will set the color of h3 and p white. <br>
         To add class selector we can simply assign a class to an HTML element and style it
         according to our choice. Inorder to style a class we have to give dot(.) sign 
         followed by the class name in CSS file.
        <code><pre>
            HTML: &lt;li class="style1">&lt;a href="#"&gt;No padding&lt/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            CSS:
            .style1 {
                list-style-type: none;
                margin-bottom: 25px;
            }
         </pre></code>
      </p>
      <h2>Combinators</h2>
      <p>Combinators are the group of selectors. We have used <i>Descendant combinator</i>
         and <i>Child combinator</i>. In descendant combinator we select element as:
         <pre><code>
             li p {
                 color: #ffffff;
             }
         </code></pre>
         Here all p with li as ancestor are selected.<br>
         In child combinator we select element as:
         <pre><code>
             h2 > p {
                 color: #ffffff;
             }
         </code></pre>
         Here only p which are direct children of h2 are selected.
      </p>
      <h2>Block vs. Inline elements</h2>
      <p>The elements which form new line and takes the full width of
          webpage are called block elements. For eg: p, h1, li etc.<br>
          The elements which doesn't form new line and only use spaces
          needed for element are called inline elements. For eg: a, img,
          span etc.
      </p>
