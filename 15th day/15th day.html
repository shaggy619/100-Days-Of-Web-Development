      <section>
        <h2>More about HTML Layout and Positioning</h2>
        <h2>HTML Tags:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;nav&gt;</li>
          <p>
            Previously we have learnt about some of the tags like
            &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;. Today we learnt
            about new tag &lt;nav&gt; tag which is a container that contains
            navigation links to the next page.
          </p>

        <h2>CSS Properties:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>text-transform</li>
          <p>
            "text-transform" property helps to change the letters of HTML
            elements to either all Uppercase or all Lowercase. <br />
            <code>text-transform: Uppercase;</code>
          </p>
          <li>text-shadow</li>
          <p>
            We have previously discussed about <i>box-shadow</i> property.
            "text-shadow" is similar to that box-shadow property but as the name
            indicates that box-shadow property was applied for box, whereas
            text-shadow property can be applied on text. Same as box-shadow it
            has four values the first one is offset along x-axis, second one is
            offset along y-axis, third one is blur amount and the fourth one is
            the color. <br />
            <code>text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px red;</code>
          </p>
        </ul>
        <h2>CSS Flexbox</h2>
        <p>
          CSS Flexbox is introduced to position html elements more easily and
          accurately. It is basically a container that helps to position
          elements. An area of document laid out using flexbox is called flex
          container. To create a flex container, we set the value of area's
          container display property to flex or inline-flex. As soon as we do
          this the direct children of that container becomes flex items. After
          doing this now we can use different flex Properties. <br />
          <code>display:flex;</code>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>flex-direction</li>
          <p>
            The flex direction property defines in which direction the flex
            items are needed to be placed. This property can have one of the
            four different values either row or column or column-inverse or
            row-inverse. <br />
            <code>flex-direction: row; </code>
          </p>
          <li>flex-wrap</li>
          <p>
            It defines whether the flex items are forced in a single line or can
            be flowed into multiple lines. The flex-wrap property accepts two
            different values:
            <ul id="bullet">
            <li>
              nowrap (default): single-line which may cause the container to
              overflow
            </li>
            <li>
              wrap: multi-lines, direction is defined by flex-direction
            </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>flex-wrap: nowrap;</code>
          </p>
          <li>flex-flow</li>
          <p>
            It contains the combined properties of flex-direction and flex-wrap.
            We can set two different values at a time with flex-flow.<br />
           <code>flex-flow: row nowrap;</code>
          </p>
          <li>align-items</li>
          <p>
            We have previously discussed about <i>text-align</i> property.
            The text-align property was used to align the text, whereas the
            align-items is used to align items within a container. <br>
            <code>align-items: center;</code>
          </p>
          <li>justify content</li>
          <p>
            The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes
            space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex
            container, and the inline axis of a grid container. We can set different
            values for this property but basically we use space-between or
            space-around or space-evenly or center. <br>
            <code>justify-content: space-between;</code>
        </ul>
