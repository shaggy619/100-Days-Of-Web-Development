      <h2 id="title">Today's Summary</h2>
      <h2>What We Learn:</h2>
      <p>
        In Today's course,we learnt about Responsive Design. Responsive Design
        means creating a website in such way that it looks good in all kind of
        devices like mobile, tablet, laptop etc. Upto the course we have only
        created the website that looks good on laptop devices. For responsive
        design we learn different new topics. In today's topic we learnt
        different units.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>px</li>
        <p>
          We have mostly used pixels as unit in our previous projects. There is
          a problem with pixels though, it is not scalable so it cannot be
          adjusted according to the screen size.
        </p>
        <li>%</li>
        <p>
          We have also used percentage as unit in our previous projects. But the
          % unit is not suitable for font though.
        </p>
        <li>em</li>
        <p>
          em stands for Ephermeral Unit. Its size is relative to font-size. So,
          it is hard to manage due to cascading nature.
        </p>
        <li>rem</li>
        <p>
          rem stands for Root Ephermeral Unit. Its size is relative to the
          elements font-size. So, it is a preffered choice if applicable.
        </p>
