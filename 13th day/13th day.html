      <h2>Git Local Basic Commands</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>
          When we have Git installed in our machine, we need to have knowlege of
          basic git commands that help to easily organize our file. All these
          commands are typed on Command Prompt. Select a direcotry where you
          want to store your project files and folders and then apply all the
          commands.
        </p>
        <li>Set user email:</li>
        <p>
          Inorder to use git you must include your email. To set our custom
          email address we use command:
          <br />
          <span class="command"
            >git config --global user.email "name@gmail.com"</span
          >
        </p>
        <li>Set user name:</li>
        <p>
          We also have to set our user name. To set our username, we use
          command:
          <br />
          <span class="command">git config --global user.name "name"</span>
        </p>
        <li>git init</li>
        <p>
          After installation of Git in our machine we need to type "git init"
          command which help to turn all the directories into git repository.
          <br />
          <span class="command">git init</span>
        </p>
        <li>Check status:</li>
        <p>
          We can check the status of the file, either the file is tracked or
          untracked. Tracked files are those files which are added/published to
          the git and untracked files are those files which are not
          added/published to the git. To check git status we use command:
          <br />
          <span class="command">git status</span>
        </p>
        <li>Add Git</li>
        <p>
          We have to add our file to git so that the git recognizes it. To add a
          file we should use command:
          <br />
          To add single file: <br />
          <span class="command">git add filename</span> <br />
          To add all untracked files: <br />
          <span class="command">git add .</span>
        </p>
        <li>Git Commit</li>
        <p>
          To keep track of what have been change we should commit our file. To
          commit we use commit -m command and write the message what have been
          changed in the previous file.
          <br />
          <span class="command">git commit -m "Description"</span>
        </p>
        <li>Git Log</li>
        <p>
          We can view our commit history using git log command.
          <br />
          <span class="command">git log</span>
        </p>
        <li>Git Checkout</li>
        <p>
          We simply delete untracked changes in the files using command git
          checkout.
          <br />
          <span class="command">git checkout .</span>
        </p>
        <li>Git Reset</li>
        <p>
          We can delete our previous commit in tracked file using command git
          reset.
          <br />
          <span class="command">git reset file1.txt</span>
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h2>Git and Github Basic Commands</h2>
      <li>Linking git and github</li>
      <p>
        To publish our code to github, we must link our git to our github
        repository. To link our git to our github repository we use the command
        "git remote add origin" followed by our repository link and add ".git"
        at the end.
        <br />
        <span class="command"
          >git remote add origin
          https://github.com/shaggy619/100-Days-Of-Web-Development.git</span
        >
      </p>
      <li>Publishing our files to Github</li>
      <p>
        To publish our files to Github, we need to write command "git push
        origin master". At the first time of using this command, you will be
        asked to fill up your github email and password and from the next time
        you won't need it.
        <br />
        <span class="command">git push origin master</span>
      </p>
      <li>Load Files to Local Computer</li>
      <p>
        There may also be some situation where you mistakely delete published
        files on your computer or you want to load the files on another
        computer, then you can simply do it using command "git clone" followed
        by the link of your repository.
        <br />
        <span class="command"
          >git clone
          https://github.com/shaggy619/100-Days-Of-Web-Development</span
        >
