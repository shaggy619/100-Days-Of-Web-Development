   <h1 style="font-family: sans-serif; text-align: center; color: red;">2nd Day of 100 Days of Code Challange</h1>
   <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">Today we have learnt about some html tags as well as some of CSS properties in this course.</br>
    We have learnt to add styling to the element with "style" tag. We also need to give property to the CSS tags using colon (:).</br>
    Example: text-align: center;</br>
    We have changed the font of element with "font-family" tag and aligned the heading to the center with "text-align" property. </br>
    Now I am also going to change the color of the heading as instructed by the instructor and I'm going to use "text-color" property for that.
