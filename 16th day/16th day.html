        <h2>Working With Background:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>background-image</li>
          <p>
            We can set image as background in our website using
            "background-image" CSS property. We can specify the path of an image
            file using <i>url("/image.jpg")</i> value. <br />
            <code>background-image: url("../image.jpg");</code>
          </p>
          <li>background-position</li>
          <p>
            We also change the position of an image using background-position
            property. This property can have one of the four values either top,
            bottom, left, right, or center. <br />
            <code>background-position: center;</code>
          </p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Working With Position of Element:</h2>
        <p>
          The position property is used to set how the HTML elements are
          positioned in the document flow. The top, right, bottom, and left
          properties determine the final location of positioned elements. We can
          set different values for position property either static or relative
          or absoulte or fixed
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>static</li>
          <p>
            This is the default value for position property.The element is
            positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The top,
            right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect.
            <code>position: static;</code>
          </p>
          <li>relative</li>
          <p>
            The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the
            document, and then offset relative to itself based on the values of
            top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the
            position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the
            element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.
            <br />
            <code>position: relative;</code>
          </p>
          <li>absolute</li>
          <p>
            The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space
            is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned
            relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it
            is placed relative to the initial containing block. Its final
            position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and
            left.
            <br />
            <code>position: absolute;</code>
          </p>
          <li>fixed</li>
          <p>
            The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space
            is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned
            relative to the initial containing block established by the
            viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform,
            perspective, or filter property set to something other than none.
            <br />
            <code>position: fixed;</code>
          </p>
