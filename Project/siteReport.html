        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          As I was very new and curious about Web Development and have never
          been involved in such course which made me a bit uneasy to learn Web
          Development module for first time. But with the help of our course
          module and teacher, Ankit Thapa it became slightly familier and
          easier. He was very liberal.
        </p>

        <h2>How This Course Started?</h2>
        <p>
          He started with basic and then slightly advanced the course. He first
          introduced about how the web works and the concepts of Git and Github.
          Then gradually he moved the course towards HTML and taught about its
          basic tags and different elements. Then he dive into the deep of the
          course and taught most of the contents which made us easier to
          understand and use different tags and elements of HTML.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>More concepts about CSS</h2>
        <p>
          Again, after the complition of HTML course, we eventually moved to the
          course of CSS where we learn different styling syntax, selectors,
          declarations, properties and values. While learning this topic I was
          enjyoing it very much and I loved practicing and playing around the
          code most of the time. I was very pleased by the way CSS styled our
          Webpage. Within few weeks we finally completed the course of CSS.
        </p>

        <h2>How I Progess?</h2>
        <p>
          There were many ups and downs while learning the overall course. But
          the way our teacher, Ankit Thapa teaches the course has really helped
          us to get along with the course. He helped us in every single steps of
          the overall course. The main reason of my progress was University
          Slide which was provided by our teacher and it is also mentioned in
          <a class="siteLink" href="https://nile.northampton.ac.uk"
            >Nile Website</a
          >
          . As I was enjyoing the course, I also explored different websites and
          YouTube and Udemy videos which really helped me get along with the
          teacher. Under the guidelines of teacher, gradually I lifted up my
          skill and get the most out of this course.

        <h2>Coding and Debugging</h2>
        <p>
          As I was keen in Web Development from the very first day and I was
          getting along with the teacher and following other websites, coding
          was becoming more easier day by day for me. And due to a lot of
          practice, I was able to write error free codes and if there occured
          any error I use to take the help of
          <a class="siteLink" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">
            MDN web docs</a
          >.

        <h2>Design, Font and Color</h2>
        <p>
          I watched different videos from YouTube and Udemy which gave me the
          concept of better design. I used the fonts - "Poppins" and "Roboto"
          from Google font. The overall layout is of Black and Blue color. I
          have used liner-gradient property in some elements like button which
          have given better color taste to the Web Page. As I had learnt some
          basics of Graphic Designing which helped me to choose better font and
          color.
