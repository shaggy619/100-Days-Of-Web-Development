    <h2>Styling Inline and Block elements</h2>
    <p>
      We can style inline elements and block elements with various properties.
      We learnt about padding and margin in today's course. Margin property
      creates space by moving other elements and padding property creates space
      around the content and doesn't move other elements.<br />
      There are certain limitations with inline elements. We cannot use vertical
      margins in inline elements. We can also make inline element behave as
      block element by setting display property to <i>inline-block</i> or simply
      <i>block</i>.
    </p>
    <h2>Understanding Margin Collapsing</h2>
    <p>
      The margin collapse occurs for vertical margins. When we set margin
      property to two near elements the margin collapse will occur. It only
      happens to the block elements. The element with larger margin value wins
      and the larger margin value overlaps the another margin value.
    </p>
    <h2>Box-Shadow Property</h2>
    <p>
      Box-shadow property is used to apply shadow around the box. We can assign
      four values to the <i>box-shadow</i> property. The first value is offset
      along x-axis, second value is offset along y-axis, third value is amount
      of blur and fourth value is the color of the box-shadow.
    </p>
    <h2>Styling Image and Working With Negative Margins</h2>
    <p>
      We have already learnt to style the image with different CSS properties,
      today we have learnt to work with the negative margins. Negative margin
      does the exact opposite work of normal margin. If we use certain margin to
      shift content downward, by adding negative sign (-) to the same margin
      value the content can be moved upward.
      <div id="note"><i>Note:</i> Margin auto helps to center an element.</div>
    </p>
    <h2>Some Tags</h2>
    <p>
      We have learnt different tags in previous class. Today we have used some
      other new tags like span tag and div tag. <i>Span</i> tag is similar to
      <i>div</i> tag, both are used to select and style elements but span is an
      inline element while div is an block level element.
    </p>
    <h2>Challange</h2>
    <p>
      We have completed a challange/project as assigned by the instructor.<br> <br>
