      <h2>What We Learn:</h2>
      <p>
        We mostly practised the previous concepts which we have already known in
        our previous course and put them in our project. We learn some few CSS
        properties like using percentage, box-sizing property and object-fit property.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using percentage value</li>
        <p>
          We have previously mostly use pixels <i>px</i> value for CSS
          properties but there might be some cases where we want to use
          percentage value for CSS properties. If we want to use some element to
          cover certain percentage of the page then we use percentage value.
          <br />
          <code>width: 100%</code>
        </p>
        <li>box-sizing</li>
        <p>
          We can use box-sizing property in CSS to determine wheter we want to
          cover the entire HTML content or border content. We can set box-sizing
          value to "content-box" if we want to cover HTML content and we can use
          the value "border-box" if we want to cover the border content. <br />
          <code>box-sizing: border-box;</code>
        </p>
        <li>object-fit</li>
        <p>
          The object-fit CSS property sets how the content of a replaced
          element, such as img or video, should be resized to fit its container.
          It basically have three value either fill or contain or cover.
          <ul id="bullet">
            <li>fill: </li>
            <p class="para">The replaced content is sized to fill the element’s content box.
              The entire object will completely fill the box. If the object's
              aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of its box, then the
              object will be stretched to fit.</p>
              <li>contain: </li>
            <p class="para">The replaced content is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while
              fitting within the element’s content box. The entire object is made to fill the box,
              while preserving its aspect ratio, so the object will be "letterboxed" if its 
              spect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of the box.</p>
            <li>cover: </li>
            <p class="para">The replaced content is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while
              filling the element’s entire content box. If the object's aspect ratio does not
              match the aspect ratio of its box, then the object will be clipped to fit.</p>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </ul>
