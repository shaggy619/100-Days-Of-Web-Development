    <h1>5th Day Of Web Development</h1>

    <h2>Adding an Image</h2>
    <p>
      We can add image to our HTML document by using <i>img</i> tag.
      <pre><code>&lt;img src="day5.png" alt="Icon of 5th day"&gt;</code></pre>
      The address of the image is defined by "src" property and "alt" is used to
      display the text if image loading is failed in HTML page.
    </p>
    <h2>Styling the Image</h2>
    <p>
      We can use various properties of CSS to style an image. We can set the
      width and height of the images with <i>width</i> and
      <i>height</i> property. We can also use <i>border-radius</i> property to
      change the borders of an Image. Setting <i>border-radius</i> property to
      100% results in changing the shape of the image to circle. You can change
      the value of <i>border-radius</i> to different percentage and play around.
      <pre><code>
      img {
      width: 200px;
      height: 200px;
      border-radius: 100%;
      }
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <h2>Styling the Overall Page Background</h2>
    <p>
      We can also change the color and background color of our whole HTML page using
      <i>background-color</i> property in CSS file. We can also give value to
      <i>margin</i> property in CSS file which will add spacing to the top,
      right, bottom and left side of the Webpage.
      <pre><code>
      body {
      background-color: #222831;
      color: #ffffff;
      margin: 70px;
      }
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <h2>Adding a Second HTML File</h2>
    <p>
      We can also add our other HTML Files in our HTML document. We can add
      using anchor tag same as adding the link which we have previously done in
      our course.
      <pre><code>&lt;a href="D:\Demo Project\1st day\1st day.html"&gt;
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <h2>Organizing Source Files in Folders</h2>
    <p>
      We can create different folders in our HTML document to manage our source
      file and differentiate each file easily. In our case we have created
      different folders according to different day which will easily help to
      find out which course was completed on which day.
